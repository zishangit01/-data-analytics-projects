✈️ Aviation Accident Analysis – Excel Dashboard
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes 88,889 aviation accident records to help identify high-risk airports, accident causes, injury severity, and long-term safety trends.
The dashboard provides valuable insights for aviation authorities, safety regulators, and airline operation teams.

🎯 Business Problem

Aviation authorities need to understand where and why accidents occur so they can improve:

Pilot training

Airport operations

Safety protocols

Risk management

Aircraft maintenance

This analysis helps in identifying the most critical areas that impact flight safety.

📊 Key KPIs

Total Aviation Accidents: 88,889

Total Fatal Injuries: 50,201

Total Serious Injuries: 21,377

Total Minor Injuries: 27,478

Total Uninjured: 441,889

🔍 Dashboard Insights (Business-Level)
1️⃣ Landing & Takeoff Are Highest-Risk Phases

Most accidents occur during landing and takeoff, indicating critical points for pilot decision-making and need for stricter runway safety standards.

2️⃣ Few Airports Contribute Majority of Accidents

Top 10 airports recorded the highest accident counts, showing location-specific risks such as weather, congestion, terrain, or operational challenges.

3️⃣ Aircraft Damage Is Substantial in Many Cases

A large percentage of accidents caused substantial or destroyed aircraft, highlighting heavy financial and safety impact for aviation stakeholders.

4️⃣ Long-Term Trend Shows Better Safety Over Time

Accident counts have gradually decreased across years, reflecting improvements in technology, pilot training, and safety regulations.

5️⃣ Private Flights Show Higher Incident Rates

Private/general aviation flights reported more accidents than commercial flights, likely due to less regulation and variable pilot experience.

6️⃣ Majority of People Remain Uninjured

Over 441k individuals reported no injuries, showing major improvements in aircraft structural safety and emergency protocols.
